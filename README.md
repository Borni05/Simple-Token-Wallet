Simple Token Wallet
Project Description
Simple Token Wallet is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract project that demonstrates fundamental blockchain wallet operations. This decentralized application allows users to securely deposit, withdraw, and manage Ether on the Ethereum blockchain through a streamlined smart contract interface.
Built with educational purposes in mind, this project showcases essential smart contract development concepts including state management, event logging, access control, and secure Ether handling. The contract provides a foundation for understanding how digital wallets operate in the decentralized finance ecosystem.
